NB: This project is inspired by a repository by Amayo Mordecai II (which can be found here: https://github.com/amayomode/Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction), to whom I owe a debt of gratitude for providing the dataset and the code I used. This endeavor simply represents an attempt to accelerate my own understanding of Artificial Intelligence.
